# Why I always atract bad person

I have been relationship for three years, but at last I found he has bad character.
And when I try to have new relationships, some bad character always find me.
I always get relationships with someone who don't want to pay a lot, but want to get a lot.
This person always very selfish, and seems very mysterious and other person don't like them.
But it always attract me.

So I think I always seek for the kicks. These persons seems be misunderstood by other people.
I am curious about that.So I make friendship with them. But when I'm into a relationship, I was dragged
by them, and I can't aknowledge the unsafe signs.

Okok,I have known that. I must be more responsible for myself. It's never mind that I am curious about
new things, I can find the truth, and learn good things.But the bad person always hurt me, hurt my peace
my happiness.

I only have one healthy freindship.And at that time, my heart was peaceful and I could easily
acquire high scores. I'm very happy everyday, with full of satisfy.

Ok, be responsible for myself.
First, take a long time to watch the person's character if want to be a friend.
Secondly, If not sure, just be immersed into my interests.
Thirdly, I have friends who is good at it. I must ask for suggestions with them.

The most importance, If I'm not sure about the person, just immersed into my interests.
