My step to learn Japanese
1. learn the Japanese syllabary
   I just watch the video in B station, to follow the pronunciation.And I go trough some articles to deeply memory the syllabary.
2. learn how to produce a sentence
3. learn the basic grammar
actually, the step 2 and 3 are mixed, I learn them together.And I recommend this video.
