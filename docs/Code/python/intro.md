1. understand the algorithms
2. understand the data structures

The book I used is [Data Structures and Algorithms in Python](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Structures-Algorithms-Python-Michael-Goodrich/dp/1118290275)

What I want to record is the hard part of the book. I will not collect the knowledge points, since I don't need to pass the exam.
