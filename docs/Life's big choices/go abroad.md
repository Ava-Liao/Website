# 24 years, I decided to go abroad

## Why I must choose to move to another country?

Actually, initially, the reason is fear. I watched different views about zhongtu in Youtube.
But when I really get a job in foreigner country, at the same time,
a woman who has great recognise told her experience about this fear,
I calmed down.But I am not regretful my choose. This is my reasons.


### I want own a global bank card
I learnt some basic saving and earning money knowledge, the saving is more important,
now I emotionally and practically made it.About the material desire,I need sleep and food,and occasionally need goods.
I am content about this situation.So now I want to earn and invest money.
When earning the money, if my work can involve in global business,that's pretty interesting.

### Cure my anxiety
I got confirmed the anxiety disorder with somatic symptoms in Shanghai.
I ate the pills, the pills really eased my symptoms, but the pills almost killed
me too.I need better and cheaper pills.I want health.
When I want to perfect my project, I feel anxiety, maybe in other people's views,
it doesn't matter, but for me, it can make me always think about this job, and can't
sleep well.

For some reason(https://www.phirda.com/artilce_29355.html),made in china(Venlafaxine).
I searched more information about this hospital and this doctor,
if someone is probably anxiety disorder, he must get this pills from the hospital.

I want to make enough money to free my time and choose.So I need jobs and projects.
Wealth deserves it.

When got job's offer, I gained the great calm.And now I can study and work steady and sure.
I try to feed my deeply desire, and really works.
